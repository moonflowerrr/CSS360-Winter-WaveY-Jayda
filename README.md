Join your friends and deploy your own trivia bot for your Discord server!

The user can now receive a welcome message with instructions. Afterwards, the user can run the "trivia" command to launch your own trivia game with friends!

The bot can deliver questions with 4 multiple choice answers. After typing an answer, the user can then be notified if the answer to the prompted question is correct or incorrect.

It will post a "Great Job!" or "Better Luck Next Time!" in the Discord server to indicate whether the user's answer was correct/incorrect. It will also allow users to enter the answer in uppercase or lowercase, and it will still work!
